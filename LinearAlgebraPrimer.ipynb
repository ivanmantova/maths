    "##### Linear Combination\n",
    "\n",
    "A *Linear Combination* of vectors is the vector of form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a_1v_1 + a_2v_2 + a_3v_3 + \\dots + a_kv_k$$\n",

    "##### Span\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of all possible linear combinations of a set of vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Linear Independence\n",
    "\n",
    "A set of vectors is *linearly independent* if no vector in the list is in the span of the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the set of vectors $(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)$ are linearly independent. Specifically, $(0, 0, 1)$ cannot be written as any linear combination of the other vectors. That is, given $a, b \\in F$, $a(1, 0, 0) + b(0, 1, 0) = (a, b, 0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Basis\n",
    "\n",
    "A list of vectors $(v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n)$ is a *basis* for $V$ if its elements are linearly independent, and their span is (the whole vector space) $V$. The *dimension* of a vector space is the length of any basis.\n",

    "##### Subspaces\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Linear maps\n",
    "\n",
    "A function $f : V \\to W$ is a linear map if it preserves the operations of addition and scalar multiplication. That is, for all $v, w \\in V, c \\in F, f(v+w) = f(v) + f(w)$ and $f(cv) = cf(v)$."
